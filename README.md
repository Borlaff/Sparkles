### S1_Earth_Moon_Sun_estimations
This notebook contains an step-by-step calculation of the surface brightness of the Sunlit (Day side) and Moonlit (Night side, illuminated by the full-moon) side of the Earth. In addition, we estimate the surface brightness of the Sunlit side of the Moon, and the Dark side of the Moon (illuminated by the reflected sunlight from Earth) as seen from the Earth. Summary of results (estimated for the u,g,r,i,z SDSS bands): 


Surface brightness of the sunlit Earth
[3.35365864 3.11365864 2.39365864 2.05365864 1.89365864] # mag/arcsec²

Surface brightness of the Moonlit Earth
[18.13169868 17.89169868 17.17169868 16.83169868 16.67169868] # mag/arcsec² 

Surface brightness of the Sunlit Moon
[4.74960755 4.50960755 3.78960755 3.44960755 3.28960755] # mag/arcsec²

Surface brightness magnitude of the Dark Side of the Moon from Earth
[15.71228034 15.47228034 14.75228034 14.41228034 14.25228034] # mag/arcsec²
